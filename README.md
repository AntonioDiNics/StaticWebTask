## Description
This is a static 'mock' store in which you are presented with different fruits to buy, their price and a 'buy' button.
There is also a footer where account creation can be done, although this is just another 'mock' version of account creation and is not functional at all. 
This was one of the first small project in which I used and learned about CSS and Bootstrap.
