        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Antonio Di Nicola. From a young age, I fell in love with video games. Later on, this interest grew into my passion for all<br>
            things technology. I knew that I wanted to be a software engineer from when I was 16 years old. I love other things too. Guitar is<br> 
            one of biggest hobbies in life. I love creating, examining and listening to music. 
        </p>

        <h2>My education</h2>
        <p>
            My high school education can be split into two different parts. Initially, I went to an all-boys, private, Catholic school.<br>
            This was your "average" high school experience - Strict rules and structure. However, due to some external circumstances, I <br>
            was placed into a smaller semi-online school for the last two years of my high school career. This was a tough change although <br>
            I did manage to adapt. I finished high school at this smaller school. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Shortly after high school, I started my HyperionDev Software Development course. Initially, this was smooth sailing for me<br>
            because of my previous experience with coding from taking IT as one of my seven subjects in high school. However, after a few<br>
            months, the difficulty of the course increased but I managed to maintain the good work.
